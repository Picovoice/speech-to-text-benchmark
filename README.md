# Speech-to-Text Benchmark

Made in Vancouver, Canada by [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai)

This is a minimalist and extensible framework for benchmarking different speech-to-text engines. It has been developed
and tested on Ubuntu using Python3.

## Background

This framework has been developed by [Picovoice](http://picovoice.ai/) as part of the
[Cheetah](https://github.com/Picovoice/cheetah) project. Cheetah is Picovoice's speech-to-text engine, specifically designed to
run efficiently on the edge (offline). Deep learning has been the main driver in recent improvements in speech recognition but due to stringent compute/storage limitations of IoT platforms, it is mostly beneficial to cloud-based engines. Picovoice's
proprietary deep learning technology enables transferring these improvements to IoT platforms with significantly lower CPU/memory footprint.

## Data

[LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) dataset is used for benchmarking. We use the
[test-clean](http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/test-clean.tar.gz) portion.

## Metrics

This benchmark considers three metrics: word error rate, real-time factor, and model size.

### Word Error Rate

Word error rate (WER) is defined as the ratio of [Levenstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
between words in a reference transcript and words in the output of the speech-to-text engine, to the number of
words in the reference transcript.

### Real Time Factor

Real time factor (RTF) is measured as the ratio of CPU (processing) time to the length of the input speech file. A
speech-to-text engine with lower RTF is more computationally efficient. We omit this metric for cloud-based engines.

### Model Size

The aggregate size of models (acoustic and language), in MB. We omit this metric for cloud-based engines.

## Speech-to-Text Engines

### Amazon Transcribe

Amazon Transcribe is a cloud-based speceh recognition engine, offered by AWS. Find more information [here](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/).

### CMU PocketSphinx

[PocketSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) works offline and can run on embedded platforms such as
Raspberry Pi.

### Google Speech-to-Text

A cloud-based speech recognition engine offered by Google Cloud Platform. Find more information
[here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/).

### Mozilla DeepSpeech

[Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is an open-source implementation of
[Baidu's DeepSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567) by Mozilla.

### Picovoice Cheetah

[Cheetah](https://github.com/Picovoice/cheetah) is a speech-to-text engine developed using
[Picovoice's](http://picovoice.ai/) proprietary deep learning technology. It works offline and is supported on a
growing number of mobile/embedded platforms including Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

Below is information on how to use this framework to benchmark the speech-to-text engines. 

1. Make sure that you have installed DeepSpeech and PocketSphinx on your machine by following the instructions on their official pages.
1. Unpack
DeepSpeech's models under [resources/deepspeech](/resources/deepspeech).
1. Download the [test-clean](http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/test-clean.tar.gz) portion of LibriSpeech and unpack it under
[resources/data](/resources/data).
1. For running Google Speech-to-Text and Amazon Transcribe, you need to sign up for the respective cloud provider
and setup permissions / credentials according to their documentation. Running these services may incur fees.

### Word Error Rate Measurement

Word Error Rate can be measured by running the following command from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python benchmark.py --engine_type AN_ENGINE_TYPE
```

The valid options for the `engine_type`
parameter are: `AMAZON_TRANSCRIBE`, `CMU_POCKET_SPHINX`, `GOOGLE_SPEECH_TO_TEXT`, `MOZILLA_DEEP_SPEECH`,
`PICOVOICE_CHEETAH`, and `PICOVOICE_CHEETAH_LIBRISPEECH_LM`.

`PICOVOICE_CHEETAH_LIBRISPEECH_LM` is the same as `PICOVOICE_CHEETAH`
except that the language model is trained on LibriSpeech training text similar to
[Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/tree/master/data/lm).


### Real Time Factor Measurement

The `time` command is used to measure the execution time of different engines for a given audio file, and then divide
the CPU time by audio length. To measure the execution time for Cheetah, run:

```bash
time resources/cheetah/cheetah_demo \
resources/cheetah/libpv_cheetah.so \
resources/cheetah/acoustic_model.pv \
resources/cheetah/language_model.pv \
resources/cheetah/cheetah_eval_linux.lic \
PATH_TO_WAV_FILE
```

The output should have the following format (values may be different):

```bash
real	0m4.961s
user	0m4.936s
sys	0m0.024s
```

Then, divide the `user` value by the length of the audio file, in seconds. The user value is the actual CPU time spent in the program.

For DeepSpeech:

```bash
time deepspeech \
--model resources/deepspeech/output_graph.pbmm \
--alphabet resources/deepspeech/alphabet.txt \
--lm resources/deepspeech/lm.binary \
--trie resources/deepspeech/trie \
--audio PATH_TO_WAV_FILE
```

Finally, for PocketSphinx:

```bash
time pocketsphinx_continuous -infile PATH_TO_WAV_FILE
```

## Results

The below results are obtained by following the previous steps. The benchmarking was performed on a Linux machine running
Ubuntu 16.04 with 64GB of RAM and an Intel i5-6500 CPU running at 3.2 GHz. WER refers to word error rate and RTF refers to
real time factor.

| Engine | WER | RTF (Desktop) | RTF (Raspberry Pi 3) | RTF (Raspberry Pi Zero) | Model Size (Acoustic and Language) |
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Amazon Transcribe | **8.21%** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
CMU PocketSphinx (0.1.15) | 31.82% | 0.32 | 1.87 | 2.04 | 97.8 MB |
Google Speech-to-Text | 12.23% | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
Mozilla DeepSpeech (0.5.1) | 8.3% | 0.46  | N/A | N/A | 2010.5 MB |
Picovoice Cheetah (v1.1.0) | 13.25% | **0.02** | **0.22** | **1.69** | 46.6 MB |
Picovoice Cheetah LibriSpeech LM (v1.1.0) | 10.47% | **0.02** | **0.22** | **1.69** | **38.2 MB** |

The figure below compares the word error rate of speech-to-text engines. For Picovoice, we included the engine that was
trained on LibriSpeech training data similar to Mozilla DeepSpeech.

The figure below compares accuracy and runtime metrics of offline speech-to-text engines. For Picovoice we included the engine that was
trained on LibriSpeech training data similar to Mozilla DeepSpeech. Cheetah achieves a performance close to the most accurate
engine (Mozilla DeepSpeech) while being 23X faster and 53X smaller in size.
